* The report is using the UWM standard BI team's BI template
* There should be a description page that is hidden to the viewers but unhidden internally, this should consist of a modification log with links to the stories with the changes
* No hardcoded sql, should take care of any sql needs in the database or with DAX
* No reading from tables or select procedures, the data the PowerBI report is utilizing should be from database views
* I verify all slicers and filters to ensure they're behaving properly, and that all expected graphs and charts are live when making adjustments to the slicers and filters
* No internal only data is being displayed in the BI if it is a business unit viewing (different then with internal IT BI reports). An example being no use of LoanRecordID and instead use LoanID unless it makes sense otherwise
* Verify the correct user group has permissions to view the BI Report
* Verify the report is correctly logged into source control
* Validate the data in the graphs and tables in the BI report match directly to the views in the database to ensure there is no accidental filtering
* Ensure that all sql server connections are to legitimate sources and are connected to production, so no test databases or inaccurate connections

//DEA-43119 (Deb Miller's)

* Spelling/ Grammar/ Punctuation is accurate
* Spacing and Layout looks clean and professional
* Buttons function as intended
* Sorting is correct/ makes sense  (things are in a logical order, such as dates, sorting buckets, etc.) 
* Visualization titles & axis labels exist and make sense based on what the visualizations are representing
* Interactions of visualizations function properly and make sense
* Counts, totals, and percentages are accurate
* Sorting and grouping makes sense
* KPI calculations are accurate, have correct labels, and contain % or commas where needed
* Slicers exist, function properly, and interact with other slicers and various visualizations as required/ makes sense
* Drillthrough page filters accurately, shows correct data, and counts match with main page of report
* Data validation: Data being presented in PowerBI report matches queries on the source tables/ views in SSMS/ Synapse/ BigQuery/ etc.


* Which visuals should interact with each other/ drilldown?
* Should slicers filter everything on the page? (KPIs and visuals?)
* Which visuals will have drillthrough pages, if any?
* Will any visuals have tooltips? If so, what info will be on the tooltip?
* Find out where data is coming from
	* Are we aggregating anything in PowerBI that is not currently aggregated on the backend?
* Calculated columns/ measures
